        â€‹In my research, I focus on advancing deep learning methodologies for hyperspectral image analysis, particularly in the realms of classification and image fusion. Hyperspectral imaging captures a wide spectrum of light across numerous contiguous bands, providing detailed spectral information for each pixel. This richness facilitates precise identification and characterization of materials in a scene, making it invaluable in fields and applications.
